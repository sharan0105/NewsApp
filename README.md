# NewsApp
This is an app to get you the news of the day for a country . By default , currently you'll be getting news only for India . 
But will be adding an option to choose your country so that you can accordingly get news for that particular country.

Developped using Dagger2 for dependency injection and RxJava with Retrofit for making and handling the network calls.

Using MVVM architecture

The app currently looks like this with a Welcome Screen , a screen which contains list of top news items in India and when you click on any of these items , it redirects you to a screen where you can view that news item in more detail.

We are also working towards integrating a sign up feature for better user experience.
